This project will make conversions from Meters, Kilometers and centimeters to these same ones.

In this project, a txt file will be read and this txt file will contain a value, unit of orgin , what the origignal unit will be converted to, all seperated by spaces, each unit will be made in abreviated form
meaning:
Kilometers: KM
Meters: M
Centimeters: CM
Example:
110 KM M
This means that we would like to know the equivalent of 110 Kilometers in meters.
The output of this program will be another text file printing out the answer for each desired conversion:
110 KM M 110000
where 110000 is the result of 110km to 110000 in meters
